Grid Methods#
getElement#
grid.getElement()

Get the grid element.

Returns  —  element

Examples

javascript
var elem = grid.getElement();
getItem#
grid.getItem( target )

Get a single grid item by element or by index. Target can also be a Muuri.Item instance in which case the function returns the item if it exists within related Muuri instance. If nothing is found with the provided target, null is returned.

Parameters

target  —  element / number / Muuri.Item
Returns  —  Muuri.Item / null

Returns the queried item or null if no item is found.
Examples

javascript
// Get first item in grid.
var itemA = grid.getItem(0);
// Get item by element reference.
var itemB = grid.getItem(someElement);
getItems#
grid.getItems( [targets] )

Get all items in the grid. Optionally you can provide specific targets (indices or elements).

Parameters

targets  —  array / element / Muuri.Item / number
An array of item instances/elements/indices.
Optional.
Returns  —  array

Returns the queried items.
Examples

javascript
// Get all items, both active and inactive.
var allItems = grid.getItems();
// Get all active items.
var activeItems = grid.getItems().filter(function (item) {
  return item.isActive();
});
// Get all positioning items.
var positioningItems = grid.getItems().filter(function (item) {
  return item.isPositioning();
});
// Get the first item.
var firstItem = grid.getItems(0)[0];
// Get specific items by their elements.
var items = grid.getItems([elemA, elemB]);
refreshItems#
grid.refreshItems( [items], [force] )

Update the cached dimensions of the instance's items. By default all the items are refreshed, but you can also provide an array of target items as the first argument if you want to refresh specific items. Note that all hidden items are not refreshed by default since their display property is 'none' and their dimensions are therefore not readable from the DOM. However, if you do want to force update hidden item dimensions too you can provide true as the second argument, which makes the elements temporarily visible while their dimensions are being read.

Parameters

items  —  array
To target specific items provide an array of item instances. By default all items are targeted.
Optional.
force  —  boolean
Set to true to read dimensions of hidden items too (and make them visible for the duration of the reading).
Default: false.
Optional.
Returns  —  Muuri

Returns the grid instance.
Examples

javascript
// Refresh dimensions of all items.
grid.refreshItems();
// Refresh dimensions of specific items.
grid.refreshItems([0, someElem, someItem]);
// Refresh dimensions of specific items and force read their
// dimensions even if they are hidden. Note that this has performance cost.
grid.refreshItems([0, someElem, someHiddenItem], true);
refreshSortData#
grid.refreshSortData( [items] )

Refresh the sort data of the grid's items.

Parameters

items  —  array
To target specific items provide an array of item instances. By default all items are targeted.
Optional.
Returns  —  Muuri

Returns the grid instance.
Examples

javascript
// Refresh the sort data for every item.
grid.refreshSortData();
// Refresh the sort data for specific items.
grid.refreshSortData([0, someElem, someItem]);
synchronize#
grid.synchronize()

Synchronize the item elements in the DOM to match the order of the items in the grid. This comes handy if you need to keep the DOM structure matched with the order of the items. Note that if an item's element is not currently a child of the grid element (if it is dragged for example) it is ignored and left untouched. The reason why item elements are not kept in sync automatically is that there's rarely a need for that as they are absolutely positioned elements.

Returns  —  Muuri

Returns the grid instance.
Examples

javascript
// Let's say we have to move the first item in the grid as the last.
grid.move(0, -1);
// Now the order of the item elements in the DOM is not in sync anymore
// with the order of the items in the grid. We can sync the DOM with
// synchronize method.
grid.synchronize();
layout#
grid.layout( [instant], [callback] )

Calculate item positions and move items to their calculated positions, unless they are already positioned correctly. The grid's height/width (depends on the layout algorithm) is also adjusted according to the position of the items.

Parameters

instant  —  boolean
Should the items be positioned instantly without any possible animation?
Default value: false.
Optional.
callback  —  function
A callback function that is called after every item in the layout has finished/aborted positioning.
Receives two arguments:
An array of all the items in the layout.
A boolean indicating if the layout has changed or not.
Optional.
Returns  —  Muuri

Returns the grid instance.
Examples

javascript
// Layout items.
grid.layout();
// Layout items instantly (without animations).
grid.layout(true);
// Layout all items and define a callback that will be called
// after all items have been animated to their positions.
grid.layout(function (items, hasLayoutChanged) {
  // If hasLayoutChanged is `true` it means that there has been another layout
  // call before this layout had time to finish positioning all the items.
  console.log('layout done!');
});
add#
grid.add( elements, [options] )

Add new items by providing the elements you wish to add to the grid and optionally provide the index where you want the items to be inserted into. All elements that are not already children of the grid element will be automatically appended to the grid element. If an element has it's CSS display property set to none it will be marked as inactive during the initiation process. As long as the item is inactive it will not be part of the layout, but it will retain it's index. You can activate items at any point with grid.show() method. This method will automatically call grid.layout() if one or more of the added elements are visible. If only hidden items are added no layout will be called. All the new visible items are positioned without animation during their first layout.

Parameters

elements  —  array / element
An array of DOM elements.
options.active  —  boolean / undefined
By default (when this option is undefined) Muuri will automatically detect from each element's display style if the item should be active (visible) or inactive (hidden) on init. If the element's display style is none then the item will be inactive on init. However, you can also provide a boolean here to force the item to be active (true) or inactive (false) on init.
Default value: undefined.
Optional.
options.index  —  number
The index where you want the items to be inserted in. A value of -1 will insert the items to the end of the list while 0 will insert the items to the beginning. Note that the DOM elements are always just appended to the grid element regardless of the index value. You can use the grid.synchronize() method to arrange the DOM elements to the same order as the items.
Default value: -1.
Optional.
options.layout  —  boolean / function / string
By default grid.layout() is called at the end of this method. With this parameter you can control the layout call. You can disable the layout completely with false, or provide a callback function for the layout method, or provide the string 'instant' to make the layout happen instantly without any animations.
Default value: true.
Optional.
Returns  —  array

Returns the added items.
Examples

javascript
// Add two new items to the end.
var newItemsA = grid.add([elemA, elemB]);
// Add two new items to the beginning.
var newItemsB = grid.add([elemA, elemB], { index: 0 });
// Skip the automatic layout.
var newItemsC = grid.add([elemA, elemB], { layout: false });
remove#
grid.remove( items, [options] )

Remove items from the grid.

Parameters

items  —  array
An array of item instances.
options.removeElements  —  boolean
Should the associated DOM element be removed from the DOM?
Default value: false.
Optional.
options.layout  —  boolean / function / string
By default grid.layout() is called at the end of this method. With this parameter you can control the layout call. You can disable the layout completely with false, or provide a callback function for the layout method, or provide the string 'instant' to make the layout happen instantly without any animations.
Default value: true.
Optional.
Returns  —  array

Returns the removed items. Note that the removal process also destroys the items so they can not be reused e.g. in another grid.
Examples

javascript
// Remove the first item, but keep the element in the DOM.
var removedItemsA = grid.remove(grid.getItems(0));
// Remove items and the associated elements.
var removedItemsB = grid.remove([itemA, itemB], { removeElements: true });
// Skip the layout.
var removedItemsC = grid.remove([itemA, itemB], { layout: false });
show#
grid.show( items, [options] )

Show the targeted items.

Parameters

items  —  array
An array of item instances.
options.instant  —  boolean
Should the items be shown instantly without any possible animation?
Default value: false.
Optional.
options.syncWithLayout  —  boolean
Should we wait for the next layout's calculations (which are potentially async) to finish before starting the show animations? By default this option is enabled so that the show animations are triggered in sync with the layout animations. If that's not needed set this to false and the show animations will begin immediately.
Default value: true.
Optional.
options.onFinish  —  function
A callback function that is called after the items are shown.
Optional.
options.layout  —  boolean / function / string
By default grid.layout() is called at the end of this method. With this parameter you can control the layout call.

grid.hide([itemA, itemB], {
  onFinish: function (items) {
    console.log('items hidden!');
  },
});
filter#
grid.filter( predicate, [options] )

Filter items. Expects at least one argument, a predicate, which should be either a function or a string. The predicate callback is executed for every item in the grid. If the return value of the predicate is truthy the item in question will be shown and otherwise hidden. The predicate callback receives the item instance as it's argument. If the predicate is a string it is considered to be a selector and it is checked against every item element in the grid with the native element.matches() method. All the matching items will be shown and others hidden.

Parameters

predicate  —  function / string
A predicate callback or a selector.
options.instant  —  boolean
Should the items be shown/hidden instantly without any possible animation?
Default value: false.
Optional.
options.syncWithLayout  —  boolean
Should we wait for the next layout's calculations (which are potentially async) to finish before starting the visibility animations? By default this option is enabled so that the visibility animations are triggered in sync with the layout animations. If that's not needed set this to false and the visibility animations will begin immediately.
Default value: true.
Optional.
options.onFinish  —  function
An optional callback function that is called after all the items are shown/hidden.
Optional.
options.layout  —  boolean / function / string
By default grid.layout() is called at the end of this method. With this parameter you can control the layout call. You can disable the layout completely with false, or provide a callback function for the layout method, or provide the string 'instant' to make the layout happen instantly without any animations.
Default value: true.
Optional.
Returns  —  Muuri

Returns the grid instance.
Examples

javascript
// Show all items that have the attribute "data-foo".
grid.filter(function (item) {
  return item.getElement().hasAttribute('data-foo');
});
// Or simply just...
grid.filter('[data-foo]');
// Show all items that have a class foo.
grid.filter('.foo');
sort#
grid.sort( comparer, [options] )

Sort items. There are three ways to sort the items. The first is simply by providing a function as the comparer which works almost identically to native array sort. The only difference is that the sort is always stable. Alternatively you can sort by the sort data you have provided in the grid's options. Just provide the sort data key(s) as a string (separated by space) and the items will be sorted based on the provided sort data keys. Lastly you have the opportunity to provide a presorted array of items which will be used to sync the internal items array in the same order.

Parameters

comparer  —  array / function / string
Provide a comparer function, sort data keys as a string (separated with space) or a pre-sorted array of items. When you provide a pre-sorted array of items you must make sure that it contains exactly the same item instances as exists currently in grid._items (retrievable safely via grid.getItems()), only change the order of items. Muuri does not validate the array of items you provide due to performance reasons.
options.descending  —  boolean
By default the items are sorted in ascending order. If you want to sort them in descending order set this to true. Note that this option has no effect when you provide a pre-sorted array of items.
Default value: false.
Optional.
options.layout  —  boolean / function / string
By default grid.layout() is called at the end of this method. With this parameter you can control the layout call. You can disable the layout completely with false, or provide a callback function for the layout method, or provide the string 'instant' to make the layout happen instantly without any animations.
Default value: true.
Optional.
Returns  —  Muuri

Returns the grid instance.
Examples

javascript
// Sort items by data-id attribute value (ascending).
grid.sort(function (itemA, itemB) {
  var aId = parseInt(itemA.getElement().getAttribute('data-id'));
  var bId = parseInt(itemB.getElement().getAttribute('data-id'));
  return aId - bId;
});
// Sort items with a presorted array of items.
grid.sort(grid.getItems().reverse());
// Sort items using the sort data keys (ascending).
grid.sort('foo bar');
// Sort items using the sort data keys (descending).
grid.sort('foo bar', { descending: true });
// Sort items using the sort data keys. Sort some keys
// ascending and some keys descending.
grid.sort('foo bar:desc');
move#
grid.move( item, position, [options] )
