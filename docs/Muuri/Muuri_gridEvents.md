Grid Events#
synchronize#
Triggered after item elements are synchronized via grid.synchronize().

Examples

javascript
grid.on('synchronize', function () {
  console.log('Synced!');
});
layoutStart#
Triggered when the the layout procedure begins. More specifically, this event is emitted right after new layout has been generated, internal item positions updated and grid element's dimensions updated. After this event is emitted the items in the layout will be positioned to their new positions. So if you e.g. want to react to grid element dimension changes this is a good place to do that.

Listener parameters

items  —  array
The items that are about to be positioned.
isInstant  —  boolean
Was the layout called with instant flag or not.
Examples

javascript
grid.on('layoutStart', function (items, isInstant) {
  console.log(items, isInstant);
});
layoutEnd#
Triggered after the layout procedure has finished, successfully. Note that if you abort a layout procedure by calling grid.layout() before items have finished positioning, this event will not be emitted for the aborted layout procedure. In such a case layoutAbort will be emitted instead.

Listener parameters

items  —  array
The items that were positioned. Note that these items are always identical to what the layoutStart event's callback receives as it's argument.
Examples

javascript
grid.on('layoutEnd', function (items) {
  console.log(items);
  // For good measure you might want to filter out all the non-active items,
  // because it's techniclly possible that some of the items are
  // destroyed/hidden when we receive this event.
  var activeItems = items.filter(function (item) {
    return item.isActive();
  });
});
layoutAbort#
Triggered if you start a new layout process (grid.layout()) while the current layout process is still busy positioning items. Note that this event is not triggered if you start a new layout process while the layout is being computed and the items have not yet started positioning.

Listener parameters

items  —  array
The items that were attempted to be positioned. Note that these items are always identical to what the layoutStart event's callback receives as it's argument.
Examples

javascript
grid.on('layoutAbort', function (items) {
  console.log(items);
  // For good measure you might want to filter out all the non-active items,
  // because it's techniclly possible that some of the items are destroyed or
  // hidden when we receive this event.
  var activeItems = items.filter(function (item) {
    return item.isActive();
  });
});
add#
Triggered after grid.add() is called.

Listener parameters

items  —  array
The items that were successfully added.
Examples

javascript
grid.on('add', function (items) {
  console.log(items);
});
remove#
Triggered after grid.remove() is called.

Listener parameters

items  —  array

  console.log(items);
});
showEnd#
Triggered after grid.show() is called, after the items are shown.

Listener parameters

items  —  array

Examples

javascript

  console.log(items);
});
hideStart#

  console.log(items);
});
filter#
Triggered after grid.filter() is called.

Listener parameters

shownItems  —  array
